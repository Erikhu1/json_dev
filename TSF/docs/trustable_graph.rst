Trustable Graph
====================

The trustable graph is the graphical representation of the argumentation. Each node represents a statement, and each arrow A â†’ B represents the statement "If A, then B" or, more verbose, "B supports A". The comprehensive list of all statements together with their trustability scores can be found `here <http://localhost:8000/generated/trustable_report_for_Software.html>`_.
