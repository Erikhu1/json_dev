# TSF Structure

The TSF-related additions, such as the Trustable Graph and tooling extensions, are primarily organized within the TSF folder:
- the items of the Trustable Graph are in `TSF/trustable` 
- the building blocks of the documentation, which is built with the S-CORE docs-as-code tool, is placed in `TSF/docs` 
- the report generated by [trudag](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trudag/usage.html) is placed in `TSF/docs/generated`. This can either be produced as part of the CI pipeline or manually using `./TSF/scripts/generate_report.sh_`. It is strongly recommended that the TSF/docs folder is included in the .gitignore file
- the utility scripts are documented in the `TSF/scripts` folder

The TSF graph (including links, nodes and their hashes) is saved in the `.dotstop.dot` file and the trudag extensions including CPP test references are stored in the `.dotstop_extensions` folder since these locations are required by the trudag tool.
