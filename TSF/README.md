# TSF Structure

The TSF additions are mainly placed in the TSF folder, where the items of the trustable graph are in `TSF/trustable` and the documentation that is built with the s-core doc-as-code is in `TSF/docs`. The report generated by [trudag](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/trudag/usage.html) is placed in `TSF/docs/generated`. This can either be produced as part of the CI pipeline or manually using the `./scripts/generate_documentation.sh script`.

The TSF graph (including links, nodes and their hashes) is saved in `.dotstop.dot` file and the trudag extensions including CPP test references are stored in `.dotstop_extensions` since these locations are required by the trudag tool. Additionally, we have added some utility scripts in the `scripts` folder.
