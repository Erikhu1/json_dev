#### Checklist for TA-BEHAVIOURS from [Codethink](https://codethinklabs.gitlab.io/trustable/trustable/print_page.html)

* How has the list of Expectations varied over time? <br>
    Answer: The list of expectations is taken from [here](https://eclipse-score.github.io/score/main/modules/baselibs/json/docs/requirements/index.html), whose development can be retraced using git.
* How confident can we be that this list is comprehensive? <br>
    Answer:  The list of expectations has been collected amongst the stakeholders in S-CORE, so that we are very confident that the list is comprehensive.
* Could some participants have incentives to manipulate information? <br>
    Answer:  We can not imagine any reason.
* Could there be whole categories of Expectations still undiscovered? <br>
    Answer:  It is unlikely, but the parsing of cbor could become relevant at some time.
* Can we identify Expectations that have been understood but not specified? <br>
    Answer:  No.
* Can we identify some new Expectations, right now? <br>
    Answer:  No.
* How confident can we be that this list covers all critical requirements? <br>
    Answer:  We can not think of any more critical requirement of a JSON parser than to parse JSON data.
* How comprehensive is the list of tests? <br>
    Answer:  The tests cover 99.186% of the code, according to coveralls, so we assume that the list of tests is quite comprehensive.
* Is every Expectation covered by at least one implemented test? <br>
    Answer:  Yes, both of the expectations are covered by at least one implemented test.
* Are there any Expectations where we believe more coverage would help? <br>
    Answer: No.
* How do dependencies affect Expectations, and are their properties verifiable? <br>
    Answer: There are no dependencies.
* Are input analysis findings from components, tools, and data considered in relation to Expectations? <br>
    Answer:  No findings have been found.
