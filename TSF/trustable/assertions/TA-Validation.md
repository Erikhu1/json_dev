I DO NOT FEEL CONFIDENT TO ANSWER THIS!

* Is the selection of tests correct?

    Answer:  

* Are the tests executed enough times? 

    Answer:  

* How confident are we that all test results are being captured?

    Answer:

    Answer:  

* If there are any gaps, do we understand why?

    Answer:  

* Are the test validation strategies credible and appropriate? 

    Answer:
