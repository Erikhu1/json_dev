As of 11/11/2025, the OpenSSF Scorecard score for 'Code-Review' in the reference https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com%2Fnlohmann%2Fjson is 3. 
This score is however misleading, as Niels Lohmann is the sole code owner and cannot review his own pull requests.
According to the OpenSSF Scorecard documentation in https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/c22063e786c11f9dd714d777a687ff7c4599b600/docs/checks.md#code-review, any unreviewed human changes causes a reduction of 7 points for this score.

For any pull requests not authored by Niels Lohmann himself, a code review is indeed performed.
